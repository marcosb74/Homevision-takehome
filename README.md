This webapp is also visible on mobile and has a live version.

**Project Details:**

This project was developed in React v17.0.2 and Typescript v4.5. The project uses Eslint/Prettier, I have used the Airbnb template as a base of my project configuration.

Libraries used:

- Axios-retry/Axios, in order to make HTTP requests and handle amount of request and time between requets.
- react-bootstrap, handles some of the css, such as the navbar and provides some components like alerts.
- react-intersection-observer, used to handle when the user reaches the bottom of the website, once triggered it will display more houses on screen
- react-spinners, a spinner that is displayed everytime a request is being proccesed.
- Eslint/Prettier, to standarize the format of the project 
- 
**In addition to this list, all necessary @types have been imported.**


**Hosting Details:**
